Last week I gave a talk where I showed how the Triggerz engineering team continuously deliver new software versions to our users.

The Triggerz product is a web application built with React, Node.js and PostgreSQL. The product has been live since October with users worldwide.

We have built a simple continuous deployment pipeline, also mostly in JavaScript, that we use to validate every push to master before deploying it automatically to production.
